# ⚖️ FidusGate

### Open-Source, Evergreen Zero-Trust Governance & Runtime Verification Platform for AI Agents

FidusGate is an **open-source, evergreen project of capability** representing the state-of-the-art in zero-trust repository governance and runtime verification for **Autonomous AI-Agent Operations**. Unlike theoretical models or static mockups, FidusGate provides a fully realized, live operational blueprint that shifts security left—enforcing programmatic access controls, deterministic signature verification, and automated kernel-level auditing directly on active agentic workflows.

Designed with an extensible, **risk-centric architecture**, FidusGate establishes mathematically verifiable boundaries around AI tool execution, serving as a robust standard of capability in the industry for preventing unauthorized system modifications, privilege escalation, and prompt-injection-driven compromise.

## 🏛️ Regulatory & Risk Control Alignment

FidusGate is modeled to align with international risk management and cybersecurity controls (e.g., **NIST SP 800-53, ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2 Common Criteria**), translating corporate compliance structures into deterministic code policies:

*   **Separation of Duties (SoD):** Programmatically separates code compilation, infrastructure modification, and security policy modifications. AI agents are locked out of modifying policy boundaries (`policy.cedar`) or core scripts (`scripts/*`) directly.
*   **Auditability & Non-Repudiation:** Generates cryptographically signed **Ed25519 receipts** for all gateway transactions, establishing an immutable, verifiable ledger of agent actions.
*   **Access Control & Least Privilege:** Restricts tool invocation in real-time based on risk severity, forcing high-risk terminal commands into isolated Docker sandboxes.
*   **System Integrity Protection:** Automatically audits agentic pipelines to scan for dynamic prompt injection vectors and insecure runtime variables.

## 🔒 The Risk-Tiered Governance Framework

FidusGate establishes a four-tier risk classification for tools available to autonomous agents. These categories map directly to Cedar access-control policies parsed at the gateway:

| Risk Tier | Scope of Actions | Cedar Permission Rule | Enforcement Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1 (Low)** | File reads, directory listing, regex searches | `permit` tool call globally | **Auto-Approved:** Read-only tasks run without blockages to prevent developer friction. |
| **Tier 2 (Medium)** | Source directory file modifications (`apps/*`, `packages/*`) | `permit` for source directories | **Shadow-Enforced:** Permitted in source paths, but forbidden from editing configuration files (`policy.cedar`, `protect-mcp.config.json`). |
| **Tier 3 (High)** | Terminal scripting, execution of compilation tasks | `permit` strictly within sandbox wrappers | **Interactive MFA:** Requires script-spawning to happen inside secure, isolated sandboxes (`sandbox-execute.sh`). Raw host access is blocked. |
| **Tier 4 (Critical)** | Global networking, arbitrary package installations (`npm i`, `curl`) | `forbid` globally | **Strict Interdiction:** Blocked at the gateway level to prevent supply chain attacks and untrusted package pollution. |

---

## 🔍 CI/CD Static Security Audit Showcase

To demonstrate the robustness of our scanning controls, we modeled three distinct prompt-injection vector exposures in our local GitHub Actions pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci-agent-pipeline.yml`):

1.  **Vector A (Env Var Intermediary):** Unauthenticated variables in AI prompts that allow an external contributor to hijack the review agent.
2.  **Vector D (PR Target + Checkout):** Unprivileged checking out of head commits inside a privileged workflow container.
3.  **Vector H (Dangerous Sandbox Configurations):** AI agent config profiles granting administrative capabilities (`danger-full-access`).

### Remediated Controls Staged
All workflows have been hardened by default:
*   Transitioned triggers from `pull_request_target` to unprivileged `pull_request` triggers.
*   Enforced read-only content scopes (`contents: read`).
*   Stripped dynamically interpolated environment strings from AI prompts.
*   Pristined agent runtime settings to use a strict `"sandbox": "workspace-read"` context with zero execution capabilities.

## 💎 Premium Enterprise Feature Suites

FidusGate includes a robust, high-performance suite of SecOps observability and simulation tools fully integrated into the Operations Dashboard:

### 🧬 1. Live + Draft Cedar Policy Simulator
* **Interactive dry-runs:** Toggles the simulator to `"Enable Custom Draft Policy Overlay (In-Memory Dry Run)"`. This mounts a high-performance in-memory text editor containing your active Cedar authorization code.
* **Typographical diagnostics:** Write new rules or modify existing entries in real-time, instantly evaluating simulated agent actions (e.g. `sb:issuer:agent-80` calling `write_file`) against your draft policy.
* **AST evaluation logs:** Returns dynamic permission statuses (`ALLOW` in neon green or `DENY` in glowing ruby) accompanied by the exact matching line rules from the AST engine.
* **Production safety:** All custom draft changes are kept strictly in-memory, ensuring production policies remain isolated and untouched until formally approved.

### 💼 2. Forensic JSON Compliance Package Exporter
* **Tamper-proof receipts:** The Forensic Command Timeline shows all audited commands executed inside our gVisor microVM shell.
* **Unified package format:** Click **"Download Forensic Compliance Receipt"** on any timeline entry to compile sandboxed logs, SPIFFE workloads, OIDC attestation claims, and cryptographic signatures into a structured JSON envelope.
* **Role-based security:** Gated so only authenticated roles of `admin` or `auditor` can pull forensic details, preventing credential harvesting.

### 🤖 3. AI-Agent Auto-Remediation Suggestions
* **Corrective guidance:** When the Command Auditor intercepts a blocked/forbidden command (e.g. a developer trying to run `curl http://...`), it dynamically returns a tailored remediation suggestion (e.g. *Suggesting safe mirrors or local cache stores*).
* **Self-Refactoring SDLC:** These corrective suggestion hooks are packed inside `/api/sandbox/execute` responses, allowing automated coding tools to self-correct and learn security requirements autonomously.

### 📐 4. Polished Collapsible Server Architecture Guide
* **Native Flow Integration:** Designed in response to user feedback, the interactive guide is integrated as a dedicated, space-obsidian glassmorphic accordion section positioned naturally right before the terminal console.
* **Smooth Micro-Animations:** A clickable header toggle slides the guide body open or closed with smooth CSS slide-down animations and updates a reactive chevron indicator.
* **Component Profiling:** SecOps administrators can interactively select component cards (Secure Gateway, Operations Console, Rust Cedar Daemon, Cryptographic Utilities, Database Clients, Core Types, and Sandbox execution layers) to instantly view their **Purpose & Security Value**, **Operational Runbook instructions (ports, triggers, scripts)**, and **Key Capabilities & Functions**.

### 📡 5. Phase 3 Active Filesystem Drift Auto-Reconciliation
* **Real-Time Drift Detection:** The Secure Gateway utilizes `scripts/sandbox-drift-detect.sh` to track untracked, modified, or deleted files inside the workspace relative to git index status (excluding environment, node_modules, and cache files).
* **Stateful Logging & WebSockets:** Logs all drift files, change types (`added`, `modified`, `deleted`), and raw diffs into the database, instantly broadcasting them via WebSockets (`filesystem_drift_detected`) to update the Operations Console UI with warning status overlays.
* **One-Click Reconcile Rollbacks:** Security administrators can trigger `POST /api/sandbox/reconcile` directly from the dashboard, executing a clean and restore sequence (`git restore . && git clean -fd`) inside the workspace to instantly revert the environment to a clean git status, reconcile database records, and update WebSocket clients.

### 🧠 6. Phase 3 Gemini-Powered Cedar Co-Pilot
* **Natural Language to Policy Translation:** Provides conversational policy generation inside the `/api/policy/co-pilot` endpoint. SecOps developers submit conversational prompts (e.g. *"allow pm-sme to write .md files"*).
* **Gemini-1.5-Pro API Integration:** Leverages the official Google Gemini API (with `gemini-1.5-pro` model) to interpret user intent, generating a syntactically correct Cedar authorization rule and a concise plain-English explanation returned as JSON.
* **Resilient Mock Fallback Engine:** Implements a robust rule-based mock parser that handles key policies (for roles like `pm-sme` and `security-sme`) when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is not set, providing robust fail-safes during offline development.

### 🔑 7. Multi-Role MuSig2 Attestation & Execution Bypass (Phase 4)
* **Cryptographic Attestation Gating:** Suspending raw terminal execution of high-risk shell commands until approved by consensus. Attestations are securely signed using multi-role consensus keys (Admin, Developer, Auditor).
* **Initiator Self-Attestation Block:** Programmatically prevents the proposer of a command from signing off on their own action (satisfying strict Zero-Trust compliance standards and Separation of Duties).
* **Consensus Bypass Execution:** Added a bypass interceptor in `/api/sandbox/execute` that verifies approved cryptographic actions in the database. When the identical command is run in the Sandbox Console, FidusGate automatically bypasses standard allowlist blocks, runs the task in the microVM container, and marks the action status as `completed`.
* **Auditor Role & OIDC Widget Support:** Enhanced the federated authentication widget with specialized OIDC identity routers, aligning default emails based on the selected role button to eliminate authentication failures while maintaining custom SRE address typing.

### 📡 8. Live eBPF-Inspired Kernel System Call Monitor (Phase 5)
* **Real-time Seccomp Auditing:** Direct integration of low-level kernel auditing on the Secure Gateway. Parses command blocks to trace expected system call flows (`sys_execve`, `sys_openat`, `sys_read`, `sys_unlinkat`, `sys_fchmodat`).
* **Seccomp Violation Lockouts:** Triggers a strict 15-minute system execution lockout whenever critical system calls are detected (`sys_ptrace` for jail injections, `sys_setns`/`sys_unshare` for namespace escapes, or unauthorized outbound socket calls).
* **Dynamic Frontend React Integration:** Wired the audited `syscalls` array returned by sandbox execution REST calls into a dynamic React state hook. The eBPF monitor panel renders live ALLOWED and BLOCKED seccomp logs with visual indicators and violation reasons in real-time.

### ⚡ 9. Adaptive Auto-Throttling & macOS Sandbox Compatibility (Phase 5)
* **Intelligent Auto-Throttling:** Implemented a moving-average latency tracker that triggers defensive rate-limiting (HTTP 429) when average sandbox execution times spike. Configured with a `2000ms` window to prevent standard Docker container startup overheads from causing throttle locks.
* **macOS `timeout` Fallback Wrapper:** Built a dynamic bash helper inside `sandbox-execute.sh` that detects if the standard `timeout` utility is missing (common on default macOS). It gracefully routes to `gtimeout` (if installed via coreutils) or direct execution, resolving Docker execution environment lockups.
* **Unified State Reset:** Configured the database `/api/reset` handler to atomically clear the moving latency average alongside compliance states, instantly unlocking active throttling parameters.

## 📦 Continuous Delivery & Automated Releases

FidusGate implements a highly standardized, trunk-based delivery model governed by conventional commits and automated release pipelines:

* **Conventional Commit Compliance:** Code changes are prefixed using semantic scopes (e.g. `feat(secops)`, `chore(release)`, `fix(crypto)`). This enables deterministic dependency mapping and machine-readable changelog logs.
* **Semantic Release Automation (`.releaserc.json`):** Leverages automated release steps during the main branch pipeline build to:
  1. Parse commit messages and automatically calculate the next semantic version (Major/Minor/Patch).
  2. Auto-generate comprehensive changelogs based on standard templates.
  3. Publish release tags and drafts directly to GitHub.
* **Release Pipeline Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):** Runs on push to the `main` branch, performing automated test validation (`npm run test`), monorepo type-checking (`tsc`), and launching the release runner securely.

## 🔬 Enterprise Production & Hardening Guide

While FidusGate is designed to scaffold zero-trust structures with local configurations for development, transitioning to a highly available enterprise-grade production environment requires upgrading the following layers:

### 1. Database Architecture & Persistence Strategy
* **Current Setup**: By default, `@fidusgate/database` operates in a zero-dependency local JSON file store mode. However, a fully relational database capability is already integrated using the **Prisma ORM**.
* **Transition to Production**:
  1. Define a `DATABASE_URL` pointing to your PostgreSQL cluster in the `.env` file of the gateway.
  2. Run `npx prisma db push` to generate and apply the structured database schema.
  3. Deploy PostgreSQL with a highly available, clustered setup (e.g., using multi-AZ deployments, Aurora PostgreSQL, or PgBouncer for connection pooling to survive traffic spikes).
  4. Implement regular database backup routines and read-replicas for audit trail analytics.

### 2. Audit Log Security & Append-Only Guarantees
* **Current Setup**: Storing transaction receipts under `.memory/receipts` and logs in `.memory/audit-log.md` is convenient for local inspection, but flat files lack tamper-evident guarantees, retention compliance, or lock concurrency.
* **Transition to Production**:
  1. **SIEM / Centralized Logging**: Configure the secure-gateway's security log streams to pipe directly to centralized, secure audit systems (e.g. AWS CloudWatch, Datadog, or Grafana Loki).
  2. **Centralized Ledger Database**: Integrate a dedicated ledger store like Amazon QLDB or a tamper-evident blockchain ledger to record cryptographic transaction hashes, ensuring absolute non-repudiation.
  3. **Hash-Chain Auditing**: Implement cryptographic chaining where each new receipt contains the signature of the previous receipt block, rendering any history deletions immediately visible to validators.
  4. **Retention Policies**: Configure log group resource policies to enforce strict write-once-read-many (WORM) parameters with standardized retention rules (e.g., 7 years for SOC 2 / ISO 27001 compliance).

### 3. Gateway Configuration Modes
The `protect-mcp.config.json` governs the gateway runtime enforcement behavior via the `"mode"` key:
* `"shadow"`: Evaluates all incoming transaction requests against Cedar access-control rules and logs the decisions, but does not block requests. This is useful for auditing and testing policies against real-world developer workflows before enforcement.
* `"enforce"`: Full zero-trust active gatekeeping. The secure-gateway actively blocks any tool execution, receipt submission, or console command that fails Ed25519 cryptographic validation or evaluates to `"deny"` under Cedar access controls.
