## 🏛️ Component Profiles

---

### 🛡️ 1. Secure Gateway Backend (`apps/secure-gateway`)

#### 🔹 Value & Function
The **Secure Gateway Backend** is the high-security core of FidusGate. It acts as the intermediary proxy through which all autonomous agent operations (such as command execution, file writes, and ledger transactions) must flow.
* **Access Control Gatekeeping:** Evaluates incoming actions against the active Cedar policy file using both a local TypeScript fallback verifier and a high-speed Rust-native gRPC daemon.
* **PII Redaction Engine:** Intercepts outgoing data packages and utilizes regex-based masking to redact sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, JWT tokens, private keys) before storage.
* **Operational Webhooks:** Dispatches incident alerts to Slack and Microsoft Teams whenever high-risk actions are blocked or CI/CD static security issues are found.

#### 🔹 Operational Runbook
* **Development Mode:** Runs concurrently within the monorepo root using `npm run dev`. It defaults to port `3001` and hot-reloads on source modifications via `tsx`.
* **Production Mode:** Deployed as a Dockerized container (`apps/secure-gateway/Dockerfile`). In production, it relies on environment variables to mount:
  - `JWT_SECRET` for secure federated admin sessions.
  - `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL storage integration.
  - `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` and `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` for instant SecOps alerts.

---

### 🎨 2. Operations Dashboard (`apps/admin-dashboard`)

#### 🔹 Value & Function
The **Operations Dashboard** is a developer and administrator interface. It provides visual observability over the autonomous agent operations, giving security staff real-time insights and dry-run playgrounds.
* **Cryptographic Attestation Grid:** Displays real-time federated OIDC OAuth signatures, SPIFFE workload IDs, and active token budget states.
* **Forensic Auditing Timeline:** Lists all commands executed in sandboxes, displaying raw arguments, exit codes, and providing audit-ready JSON receipt downloads.
* **Interactive Policy Simulator:** Toggles a dry-run canvas allowing administrators to draft custom Cedar policies and instantly evaluate mock inputs without overwriting production rules.
* **Ledger Verifier:** Incorporates a client-side public-key verification helper confirming Ed25519 signature receipts, guaranteeing non-repudiation.

#### 🔹 Operational Runbook
* **Development Mode:** Runs on Vite at port `3000`. Starts via `npm run dev` and communicates with the Secure Gateway via Vite's proxy configurations.
* **Production Mode:** Compiles into highly optimized, static assets via `vite build` (outputs to `dist/`), which are then served via Nginx or a lightweight static file server inside a Docker container.

---

### 🦀 3. Rust Cedar Policy Daemon (`packages/cedar-daemon`)

#### 🔹 Value & Function
The **Rust Cedar Policy Daemon** provides the high-performance authorization backbone of the platform. Written in Rust, it interfaces directly with the official AWS-backed `cedar-policy` crate, guaranteeing strict conformance to Cedar specifications.
* **Schema-Guided Validation:** Enforces strict types on entity contexts using `policy.cedarschema`. This prevents typological mismatch attacks, ensuring that arbitrary properties injected into evaluations do not bypass authorization boundaries.
* **In-Memory Decisioning:** Resolves complex authorization trees in microseconds, preventing pipeline lag for high-throughput AI agents.

#### 🔹 Operational Runbook
* **Compilation:** Managed via the package build task `npm run build --workspace=@fidusgate/cedar-daemon`, which triggers a multi-stage Docker build (`Dockerfile`) to compile the Rust binary in a release configuration.
* **Runtime:** Spawns as an independent microservice container on port `50051`. The secure gateway sends HTTP/REST authorization payloads to the daemon for evaluation, falling back gracefully to the TypeScript engine if the container is offline.

---

### 🔑 4. Cryptographic Utilities (`packages/crypto-utils`)

#### 🔹 Value & Function
The **Cryptographic Utilities** package provides the cryptographic engine for FidusGate, establishing a zero-trust model of non-repudiation.
* **Receipt Signature Blocks:** Signs audit logs using **Ed25519** public-key cryptography, embedding public keys, hashes of action payloads, and OIDC claims in a signed envelope.
* **HSM & KMS Providers:** Integrates transit signing pipelines pointing directly to **HashiCorp Vault Transit Engine** or **Google Cloud KMS AsymmetricSign** endpoints.
* **Verification CLI:** Exposes an offline command-line verifier allowing regulators to confirm receipt integrity without access to the FidusGate server.

#### 🔹 Operational Runbook
* **Library Import:** Imported as a local workspace dependency (`@fidusgate/crypto-utils`) by the secure-gateway.
* **CLI Execution:** Can be executed locally to generate keypairs or verify receipts:
  ```bash
  # Generate new Ed25519 keypair
  node packages/crypto-utils/dist/index.js --generate-keys
  
  # Verify a receipt JSON file
  node packages/crypto-utils/dist/index.js --verify receipt.json
  ```

### 💾 5. Core Database Client (`packages/database`)

#### 🔹 Value & Function
The **Core Database Client** manages transaction persistence across local and cloud environments, allowing FidusGate to operate as a low-overhead developer sandbox or a heavy-duty enterprise cluster.
* **Dual-Engine Design:** Detects the environment and operates in a zero-dependency, local file store mode (`command-logs.json`) for local development, or a full relational schema model using the **Prisma ORM** for production.
* **Seeded Security Assertions:** Automatically seeds mock compliance records, cryptographic SME roles, and sandbox operations logs on initialization to guarantee instant diagnostic capability.

#### 🔹 Operational Runbook
* **File Store Mode:** Defaults to reading/writing to `.memory/` directory local files.
* **Database Mode (PostgreSQL):** Activated by defining a `DATABASE_URL` in your environment. Run `npx prisma db push` to generate and apply the structured schema.

---

### 📝 6. Unified Core Types (`packages/core-types`)

#### 🔹 Value & Function
The **Unified Core Types** package defines the strictly typed structural boundaries of the monorepo.
* **Data Consistency:** Establishes shared TypeScript interfaces for transaction payloads (`Transaction`), cryptographic receipts (`AuditReceipt`), forensic logs, and compliance findings.
* **Contract Security:** Ensures that developers cannot alter telemetry shapes in the frontend or database without satisfying compiler requirements across all packages.

#### 🔹 Operational Runbook
* **Compilation:** Compiled using `tsc` to distribute JS outputs and ambient declarations (`.d.ts`).
* **Importing:** Included at the absolute top of the package dependency tree, imported globally via `@fidusgate/core-types`.

---

### 🐳 7. Isolated Execution Sandbox (`scripts/*`)

#### 🔹 Value & Function
The **Execution Sandbox** manages runtime virtualization, guaranteeing that high-risk terminal commands executed by autonomous agents cannot contaminate the host environment.
* **gVisor Sandbox Hardening (`setup-gvisor.sh`):** Configures Docker runtimes to use the `runsc` secure container sandboxing engine on Linux.
* **Ephemeral Overlay Mounts (`sandbox-execute.sh`):** Mounts the primary codebase as read-only (`ro`) and overlays a copy-on-write memory volume inside the execution container, discarding temporary modifications after calculating the final patch file.
* **Local CI/CD Emulation (`ci-verify.sh`):** Leverages `act` to boot unprivileged workflows, verifying security gates entirely offline inside local Docker networks.

#### 🔹 Operational Runbook
* **Execution:** Spawns transparently whenever the dashboard console executes a command or sandbox playbook:
  ```bash
  # Execute an arbitrary shell script inside the secure sandbox
  bash scripts/sandbox-execute.sh "npm run test" "/Users/sagehart/Documents/project"
  ```

---

### 📦 8. Custom GitHub Action Guard (`packages/github-action`)

#### 🔹 Value & Function
The **Custom GitHub Action Guard** extends FidusGate's runtime governance policies into the continuous integration (CI) pipeline. It acts as an automated static and dynamic audit checkpoint, running checks on pull requests before changes are merged.
* **Commit Cryptographic Audit Receipt Verification:** Connects to `@fidusgate/crypto-utils` to verify that commit audit signatures on changes were signed by a registered, cryptographically authorized AI agent or developer.
* **Pipeline Prompt Injection Auditing:** Scans the active workflow configuration (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) for dynamic interpolation of user-controlled variables (e.g., `${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}`) in bash runs or prompts to protect against CI environment hijack.
* **Rule-Based Access Checking:** Ensures only valid changes are permitted to run within privileged environments.

#### 🔹 Operational Runbook
* **Workflow Configuration:** Mounted as a step within `.github/workflows/ci-agent-pipeline.yml` or standard CI runner configuration:
  ```yaml
  - name: FidusGate SecOps Guard
    uses: ./packages/github-action
    with:
      fidusgate_root_key: ${{ secrets.FIDUSGATE_ROOT_KEY }}
  ```
* **Build Procedure:** Spawns TypeScript compiler to emit single-file execution package under `packages/github-action/dist/index.js` which is executed directly via `node20` runner environments.

## ⚙️ Core Feature Architectures & Observability Flows

FidusGate implements several reference modules designed for governance and auditing:

### 1. Live + Draft Cedar Policy Simulator
* **Architecture:** Exposes a secure endpoint `/api/policy/simulate`. When active, it parses the input JSON structure `{ principal, action, context }`.
* **Dry-Run Isolation:** Toggling in-memory drafts runs the request against a temporary, sandboxed AST instantiation inside `cedar-evaluator.ts`. It reads matching policy IDs and maps them to clean user-facing comments in-memory, returning diagnostic matches without touching `policy.cedar` on the host filesystem.

### 2. Forensic JSON Exporter
* **Tamper-Evident Receipts:** Integrates securely with `/api/logs/compliance/:logId/export`.
* **Packaging Strategy:** Resolves log histories, matches them to OIDC OAuth attestation scopes (`GET /api/auth/attested-claims`), compiles Ed25519 signature strings, and bundles the resulting telemetry into a structured JSON envelope download. Gated exclusively to `admin` and `auditor` roles.

### 3. AI-Agent Auto-Remediation Suggestions
* **System Design:** Command-line inputs are parsed via `command-auditor.ts` using tokenizer regular expressions.
* **Correction Loops:** If blocked execution patterns are detected, the gateway returns a custom recommendation structure within the JSON payload. Autonomous coding agents scan this field to self-correct command invocations.

### 4. Interactive Collapsible Portals Guide
* **UX Integration:** Positioned as an inline collapsible accordion panel in `App.tsx` directly above the terminal shell window.
* **Animations & Styles:** Uses transition rules in `App.css` to open/close dynamically under a single React state trigger (`showArchPanel`), providing visibility of system runbooks to SecOps auditors.

### 5. Active Filesystem Drift Auto-Reconciliation (Phase 3)
* **Real-time Porcelain Scans:** Spawns `scripts/sandbox-drift-detect.sh` inside the active workspace path on transaction events. It captures porcelain status lines (e.g. `M`, `??`, `D`), filtering configuration and environment directories.
* **Prisma Schema Logs:** Records file paths, action statuses (`added`, `modified`, `deleted`), and computes full Git diff patches inside a dedicated `FilesystemDrift` table (or local `drifts.json` backup).
* **WS-Driven Alert Broadcast:** Dispatches changes to active administrator dashboards via WebSockets, rendering live UI overlays of environment contamination.
* **Transactional Revert Endpoint (`/api/sandbox/reconcile`):** Executes `git restore . && git clean -fd` to atomic rollback the workspace to a pristine git state, marked statefully as reconciled in the database to clear dashboard indicators.

### 6. Gemini-Powered Cedar Co-Pilot (Phase 3)
* **Natural Language Processing Loop:** Translates standard speech patterns into active Cedar authorization code inside the `/api/policy/co-pilot` Express route.
* **API Synthesis:** Relies on a standard POST payload with a `prompt` field. It executes an authenticated HTTPS call to the Google Gemini model endpoint `gemini-1.5-pro`, requesting strict structured JSON response boundaries.
* **Stateful Fallbacks:** Spawns a local pattern-based mock parser in the event `GEMINI_API_KEY` is not present, ensuring that local developer test cycles for key administrative or pm roles return syntactically valid Cedar permit policies instantly without offline failure.

### 7. Conventional Commits & Semantic Release Workflow
* **Deterministic Versioning:** Integrates semantic-release libraries inside the workspace, configuring conventional commit analyzers that scan commit formats (`feat(...)`, `fix(...)`, `docs(...)`) to determine version iterations automatically.
* **Changelog Compilers:** Auto-compiles markdown files summarizing development contributions and patches on successful trunk pushes, drafting release archives entirely via automated actions.
