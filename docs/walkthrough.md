# ⚖️ Walkthrough: FidusGate Upgrades & Security Hardening

This walkthrough details the successful implementation and auditing of FidusGate's four security, operations, and AI developer experience enhancements.

---

## 🏛️ Executive Summary

FidusGate has been successfully matured from a local agent sandbox into a high-performance, and cryptographically tamper-evident **AI DevSecOps Governance Reference Implementation**. 

All integrated systems operate in **100% backward-compatible configurations**, seamlessly running in both production PostgreSQL environments and lightweight zero-dependency flat-file JSON mock database fallbacks.

## 🔑 1. Cryptographic Receipt Hash-Chaining (`packages/crypto-utils`)

To establish tamper-evident audit logs (illustrating non-repudiation concepts) and prevent historical audit tampering, we successfully integrated a receipt ledger digest chain:

- **Mathematical Digests:** Added `hashReceipt` helper to `@fidusgate/crypto-utils` executing `SHA-256` digests over raw receipt structures.
- **KMS Wrappers:** Built modular Transit Key routing supporting hardware security module (HSM) signing wrappers for AWS KMS (`Sign` endpoint) and GCP KMS (`AsymmetricSign` endpoint), automatically falling back to secure local keypairs in developmental modes.
- **Verification:** Unit tested 7 core cryptographic key-verification vectors, passing with 100% correctness.

---

## 💾 2. Core Database Schema Upgrade (`packages/database`)

The database client was statefully upgraded to track hash-chain digests and enforce global administrative controls:

- **Schema Evolution:** Modified `prisma/schema.prisma` to add continuous chaining attributes (`receiptHash` and `previousReceiptHash`) inside `AuditReceipt`.
- **Global Configuration:** Introduced the stateful `SystemConfig` model to persist real-time control metrics, including the Global Circuit Breaker active status (`circuitBreakerActive`) and Sprint Token Limits (`agentTokenBudget`).
- **Autonomic Hash Chaining:** Extended `addReceipt` inside `database/src/index.ts` to fetch the previous receipt in the ledger, inject its digest block as `previousReceiptHash`, calculate the new chain digest, and atomically write the receipt.

---

## 🛡️ 3. Secure Gateway Integration (`apps/secure-gateway`)

- **JSON Autofixes:** Extended `command-auditor.ts` to return structured `suggestedAutofix` blocks when restricting developer/agent shell operations (e.g. suggesting safe `npm run bootstrap` workspaces). This autofix payload is now integrated into the `/api/sandbox/execute` route responses and verified in tests.
- **Emergency Circuit Breaker:** Mounted global Express middleware that intercepts all incoming agent queries and blocks command executions instantly when `circuitBreakerActive === true` is toggled in the DB.
- **OpenTelemetry Observability:** Integrated standard performance counters and duration hooks tracing authentication gateways, Cedar evaluations, and database transaction rates.
- **Hot-Reload Commit API:** Added the secure `POST /api/policy/apply` administrative endpoint to programmatically write and instantly reload Cedar policies on the active host filesystem (`policy.cedar`).

---

## 🎨 4. Operations Dashboard Upgrades (`apps/admin-dashboard`)

FidusGate's developer dashboard has been enriched with interactive sections:

### 🚨 Emergency global circuit breaker (Kill-Switch)
Placed inside Card 1 (Cryptographic SME Role Keys & Attestation Graph) under the **Compliance Panel**. When activated by an authorized admin:
- Instantly toggles FidusGate into a fully restrictive "Suspended" mode.
- Triggers visual warnings and alerts on the UI.
- Logs alert status messages directly into the Unified Security Shell.

### 🤖 Gemini Cedar Co-Pilot Playground
Added as a widescreen sidebar console inside the **Cedar Policy Tab**:
- Accepts natural language inputs describing security permissions.
- Invokes Google Gemini (with configurable model settings, defaulting to the `gemini-1.5-pro` model) to instantly translate sentences into syntactically valid Cedar code blocks and clear rationale explanations.
- Features a mock fallback engine to prevent blocking developers when API credentials are omitted.
- Seamlessly connects with the Visual Simulator via a **"Simulate Draft"** handler to execute dry-runs, and includes an admin **"Commit to Prod"** button to write rules directly to host disk.

### 📊 OpenTelemetry Telemetry Cards
Added a dedicated OTel Latency & Rate Tracing card displaying micro-sparkline metrics that reflect real-time active or flatlined statistics based on circuit breaker states.

### 💡 Interactive Suggested Autofixes Banner
Added a dedicated, collapsible **Suggested Autofix Banner** above the Sandbox Console prompt. If a shell command execution fails due to a policy block (e.g., trying to install packages directly or running forbidden utilities):
- The banner displays the proposed safe replacement command.
- Clicking the **"Apply Fix"** button automatically executes the safe command in the isolated sandbox, clearing the input and resolving the policy violation in one click.

### 🔑 4.5. Multi-Role Consensus Attestation & Execution Bypass (Phase 4)
* **Cryptographic Attestation & Proposer Block:** Implemented strict Zero-Trust consensus controls preventing the proposer of a command from self-attesting. The "Attest & Sign" button displays an **"Initiator Blocked"** badge if the logged-in user email matches the action's proposer.
* **Approved Command Terminal Bypass:** Added a bypass routing mechanism in `/api/sandbox/execute` that verifies approved cryptographic actions in the database. Running the exact pre-approved command in the Sandbox Console skips the standard allowlist block, executes inside the isolated sandbox container, and flags the action as completed.
* **Auditor Role & OIDC Widget Support:** Upgraded the federated OIDC authentication portal to dynamically align default identity emails (e.g. `auditor@fidusgate.internal`) based on role buttons, preventing authentication transaction rejections.

### 📡 4.6. Simulated Seccomp Auditing and Syscall Flow Modeling (Phase 5)
* **Live System Call Auditing:** Wired a simulated system call flow model inside the Sandbox engine, tracing expected calls (`sys_execve`, `sys_openat`, `sys_read`, `sys_unlinkat`, `sys_fchmodat`).
* **Dynamic seccomp Logs:** Linked the frontend console with the live audited `syscalls` array using React state hooks. The syscall monitor panel maps over these simulated system call events, showing `ALLOWED`/`BLOCKED` seccomp logs and violation lockouts.
* **macOS Sandbox & Auto-Throttling Compatibility:** Added macOS compatibility wrappers for `timeout` execution inside the isolated sandbox container, and raised the Auto-Throttle moving average threshold to `2000ms` to prevent standard Docker container startup latencies from triggering throttle blocks.
